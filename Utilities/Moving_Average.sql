#The main idea is to examine how the averages behave over time instead of examining the behavior of the original or raw data points
#Working with moving averages gives us a better representation of the time series, since longer-term trends are much easier to see with moving averages than with raw data points
#Smoothing is the main objective of the moving average technique; it is used to remove noise from the data. With less noise, the real trends in time series data are easier to see.
#Analysis of confirmed COVID-19 cases: moving averages help show how the trend of number of confirmed cases is changing over time.
