#Allow us to add aggreate values to non-grouped result sets, 
#so that we leave the non-aggregated variables the way they are, and add columns that contain aggregated values
#We can add 'down-column' calculations (e.g., average, max, min, sum) to non-grouped results, based on certain rows of the data
